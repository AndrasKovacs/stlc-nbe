On this branch we have an unfinished attempt at an alternative proof strategy. Here we prove normalization, completeness and confluence in a single logical relation, in a way such that stability would imply soundess as well. Unfortunately, the large amount of proofs inside the normalization function makes the proof of stability quite ugly (full of coercion-shuffling), so I haven't done it yet. Since the master branch has the full correctness proof, I am not particularly motivated to finish this one.
