Things to generally know:

1. we need to begin theorems as:

  \
  \begin{theorem}

   for some obscure reason

2. We have all the Agda unicode characters in monospace code blocks, but
   basically none of them in $$ latex blocks. In latex blocks we have to
   use latex commands and symbols. Unfortunately, we can't teach latex
   the unicode symbols with "newunicodechar",  because that wrecks the
   unicode symbols inside Agda code blocks.

3. We have pandoc-citeproc-preamble, and use the
   .pandoc/citeproc-preable/default.latex to format citations.

4. We should use flyspell-mode or ispell every now and then
