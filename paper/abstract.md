abstract: "We implement and prove correct normalization by evaluation for simply typed lambda calculus, using the proof assistant Agda. The correctness proof consists of soundness, completeness and stability with respect to $\\beta\\eta$-conversion. The algorithm uses a Kripke model over the preordered set of order-preserving context embeddings. Completeness is given by a logical relation between the term model and the Kripke model. For soundness and stability, we first need to prove that evaluation, quoting and unquoting all commute with order-preserving embeddings, which amounts to showing that the codomain of the evaluation function can be refined to a presheaf model. Then, soundness is shown by a logical relation on semantic values which fall into the refined model. Stability is proved by induction on normal and neutral terms. Decidability of $\\beta\\eta$-conversion for terms also follows from correctness. The main advantage of the formalization is that normalization has a concise and structurally recursive specification and is presented separately from the correctness proofs. Also, the syntax of terms remains simple, making no use of explicit substitutions or closures. Overall, the technical overhead of the development is relatively light."
